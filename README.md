# PicoRadar
Various code for the Pico Radar Station Camp

## Examples
This folder contains short examples how to use the indivitua components, like the ultrasonic sensor, the servo motors, the display and the buttons. Note Button A does not work in the current setup - it uses a reseved pin for CircuitPython.

## Radar
This folder contains four different versions of the radar code from a simple display to buzzer and button use to the sweep radar diagram.

## Coding
The Raspberry Pico uses <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython">CircuitPython</a> and should show up like a flash drive calles CIRCUITPY on the computer. The code in the file `code.py` will be executed once the Pico is powered. The files are stored onm the device.

There are two convenient ways to code and communicate with the Pico and CircuitPython:

- <a href="https://codewith.mu/">MuEditor</a> - needs to be installed on your computer
- The <a href="https://urfdvw.github.io/circuitpython-online-ide-2/">online editor</a> we used in class - runs in a browser. 
- .. and there are more ways :)

## Hardware

- <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/overview">Raspberry Pico with WiFi</a> 
- <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.14">Waveshare LCD Display</a>

Have fun.
